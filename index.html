	<h1>Dinosaurs are amazing!</h1>
	
	<p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Diniosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, 231.4 million years ago, and were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135 million years, from the beginning of the Jurassic (about 201 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago), when the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of the most dinosaur groups at the close of the Mesozoic Era.</p>
